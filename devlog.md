OMG... I don't like what I made

Why is this so hard?

Ugh.. I can't start over, what I had is close it just needs tweaks

Alright today is the day, really need to get this done/move on.

2:46 PM
Slow progress had to backtrack from what I had designed, went another direction.

3:03 PM
I'm failing, feel tired

Lucky for me the balances all start at 0 in 2021 since I wasn't using CBP till then.

4:38 PM
Ahh man... back to this, so now the UI looks like this

I have to do the computation again... generally it looks good but I am seeing some negative values later down which is not good (rounding problem).

Distracted this is towards the end of the day when my mind starts to shit the bed

Mad distracted, had to chase the sunlight real quick to test my solar cells project

I'm going to go build the client-based visual version.

I want to paint the buy/sell groups as expandable/interactive rows to correct the CSVs before producing them.

1:41 PM
Lucky for me I did not start using CBP until 2021. But in the future eg. 2022 I have to keep that in mind regarding coin held from 2021.

3:02 PM
I made hte original repo private as I accidentally uploaded my CSV file, it's not a huge deal, but still... I didn't intend to do that.

Also I decided to change how I'm going to do it. Have a new plan.
