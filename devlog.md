Alright today is the day, really need to get this done/move on.

Slow progress had to backtrack from what I had designed, went another direction.

I'm failing, feel tired

Lucky for me the balances all start at 0 in 2021 since I wasn't using CBP till then.

I'm going to go build the client-based visual version.

I want to paint the buy/sell groups as expandable/interactive rows to correct the CSVs before producing them.

Lucky for me I did not start using CBP until 2021. But in the future eg. 2022 I have to keep that in mind regarding coin held from 2021.

I made hte original repo private as I accidentally uploaded my CSV file, it's not a huge deal, but still... I didn't intend to do that.

Also I decided to change how I'm going to do it. Have a new plan.
